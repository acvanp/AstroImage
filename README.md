2.Convert the images to TIF if you need to.
3. Align the images using the align script. Select the images to align with the QT widget. Click on a given star to align all the images on. This writes the alignment points to a JSON file.
4.  Average and process the lights, flats and darks.
5.  Use ImageJ for post processing.
